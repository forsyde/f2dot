# DETAIL_LEVEL determines the maximum level for recursive parsing of
# xml files. In other words, it decides the level of detail plotted in
# the graph. Once that level has been reached, all composite processes
# are turned into "black boxes" and drawn as leaf processes. May be
# overridden by command-line arguments.

# LEAF_INFO_TAGS decides what information should appear in the leaf
# process nodes. This information is extracted from the XML files,
# through XPath queries, included in a custom layout markup.  The tool
# has XPath 1.0 support. For a tutorial on how to build lable queries,
# please consult f2dot's web page.
